# TitanicKNN

Basic learning machine example:
I used KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn library to predict Titanic passengers' survival.

Files:

- 'TitanicKNN.ipynb' - my code in Python
- 'Titanic'- directory with all data: 
    -> 'train'- training data used to train the model;
    -> 'dev-0'- valid data used to check model's accuracy;
    -> 'test-A'- test data for which we actually predict;
